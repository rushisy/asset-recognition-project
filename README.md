# asset-recognition-project

## train asset recognition program


- import raw data from bnsf
- identify all different assets (update with full list)
- geo-locate assets via forward facing camera mounted perpendicular to track at the top of the train
- create digital twins in conjunction with gps tracking to view exact location of train at any given time
- replicate feature similar to GTA 5 where cops have viewing radius if wanted level increases, same idea just with trains on tracks (ex below)
